NOTES

OUTLINE

1. First we will need to run out to the RNW website and check out some of the "Get Started" docs. They have some handy things too.....get you started
    - A really useful script to make sure you have all the correct requirements installed for the "LATEST" version.
        - https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnw-dependencies
        - small con, if you ever need to install an older version (say based on VS2019) then you need to make sure you reference the correct requirements script
    - First you are gonna setup a react native app THEN you are going to add a windows react native project to it....kind of 
    - as soon as the template is built up you can run it and it will work!
